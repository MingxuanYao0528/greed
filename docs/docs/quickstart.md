## Installing from Source

???+ tip
       ‚≠êÔ∏è We strongly suggest using a python virtual environment rather than installing
       greed globally. Doing so reduces dependency conflicts and aids in
       reproducibility while debugging. Some popular tools that accomplish this
       include [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


```bash
git clone git@github.com:ucsb-seclab/greed.git
mkvirtualenv greed
workon greed
./setup.sh
```


## Usage 
First, the contract needs to be pre-processed with gigahorse. This can be done in two ways:

```bash
# Analyses will pollute the current working directory
mkdir /tmp/test_contract
cd /tmp/test_contract/

# OPTION 1: From the solidity source
cp <contract_source> contract.sol
analyze_source.sh contract.sol

# OPTION 2: From the contract bytecode
cp <contract_bytecode> contract.hex
analyze_contract_hex.sh contract.hex
```

The bytecode analyses should work on any system where gigahorse can be properly compiled.
