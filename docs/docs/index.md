# Welcome to greed's documentation!

Welcome to `greed`'s documentation! This documentation is intended to be a quick guide to use greed: our symbolic execution engine for EVM smart contract binaries.

If `greed` makes you think of `angr`, is because we are basically from the same research group (UCSB Seclab). 
Some of the folks developing `greed` are also `angr`'s contributor, thus, many of the choices in this project are inspired by `angr`.
