## State Plugins

State plugins are (yet-another) concepts that greed borrowed by angr.
A state plugin is designed to add any additional per-state-context that a SimState should carry with itself during its life-cycle.
For instance, the default "globals" State Plugin can carry global variables useful for future decision of an exploration technique such as the number of time a specific loop has been iterating.

Users can design their own State Plugins by implementing the [SimStatePlugin](https://github.com/ucsb-seclab/greed/blob/main/greed/state_plugins/plugin.py) interface and installing it to a SimState.
The two main functions that need to be implemented when designing a custom plugin are: `__init__` and `copy`.
The former initializes the plugin with its starting values, while the latter is responsible of implementing a full deep copy of the plugin state whenever the Simulation Manager decides to fork a SimState during symbolic execution (i.e., every plugins carried by a forking state must be cloned into its successors).

After you created a new plugin (e.g., `myNewStatePlugin`) you can install it into a state with:

```python
>>> state.register_plugin("myPluginName", myNewStatePlugin())
```

Later, you can access the methods and attributes of that plugin using the installed name:

```python
>>> state.myPluginName.hi
```

## Memory Model

Symbolic memory writes (and reads) are arguably one of the most critical issue a symbolic executor needs to deal with to mantain a good balance between precision and scalability.
Many different strategies have been proposed during the past years that ranges from nested ITE expressions to full SMT Array, to a more balanced segmented memory model (this [paper](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~delia/papers/svtr19.pdf) does a pretty good job in providing an overview of all the currently available solutions).

Our choice for greed landed on a similar design employed by Frank et al. in [ETHBMC](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20fall_frank_prepub_0.pdf). Specifically, we leverage an [extended version](https://llbmc.org/files/papers/VSTTE13.pdf) of the Theory of Array to model both the memory and the storage of a smart contract. We dubbed this memory model the "LambdaMemory".
Thanks to the LambdaMemory, every memory operation can be always kept symbolic through the use of the `Select` and `Store` SMT Array operations, additionaly, we can symbolically model 'memcopy' operations triggered by opcode such as `CALLDATACOPY`.

While this memory model drastically improve the precision of symbolic execution (i.e., we do not have to early-concretize symbolic variables), the drawback is a bit more complexity in the constraints, and the loss of inspectability of those.
Specifically, differently from angr, inspecting a variable pulled from memory will merely show a `Select` operation rather than a full explicit ITE operation.

## Partial Concrete Storage

???+ note
       In order to enable this mode an access to a web3 RPC is required. You can set the web3 provider via the option WEB3_PROVIDER in the greed [options](https://github.com/ucsb-seclab/greed/blob/main/greed/options.py#L12) file.
       If you do not have a private node, you can use one of the public provider such as [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

A fully symbolic contract storage is not always a desirable option when performing symbolic execution.
In fact, when we want to analyze the state of a contract at a specific block, we might want to use the concrete values in its storage to prune some unfeasible paths and in general simplify the symbolic execution.

To do this, greed supports a "Partial Concrete Storage" mode that can be activated when creating a SimState:

```python
>>> ctx = {"ADDRESS": "0x6b6Ae9eDA977833B379f4b49655124b4e5c64086", "NUMBER": 18808898}
>>> entry_state = p.factory.entry_state(xid=xid, init_ctx=ctx, partial_concrete_storage=True)
```

When this mode is activated, whenever there is an `SLOAD` (let's say at slot id `0x5`), we are going to use the storage of the contract `ADDRESS` (e.g., `0x6b6Ae9eDA977833B379f4b49655124b4e5c64086`) at block `NUMBER` (e.g., `18808898`) and automatically returns the value of slot `0x5` in the contract real storage (instead of a symbol).

Further `SSTORE` (performed during symbolic execution) at slot `0x5` will overwrite this value. In other words, you can imagine this mode of operation as a "lazy" initialization of the storage of a contract (in the symbolic executor) with its real values on chain (at a specific block).

## External Calls

Currently we do not ship greed with a support for external calls, i.e., whenever one of the call opcodes (`CALL`/`DELEGATECALL`/`STATICCALL`/`CODECALL`) is executed during symbolic execution, our handlers are simply "skipping" the call and fill up the returned virtual register according to the option `OPTIMISTIC_CALL_RESULTS` (if set, it will put the value `1` inside the result virtual register indicating the call was successfull).

While this can be enough for certain analyses, some other times it might be important to follow the execution flow and keep executing the opcode in the target contract (of the call). This is currently a feature that must be implemented on top of greed.

???+ note
       Implementing this feature requires particular care, especially in cases of re-entrant code.


## Keccak256

In the EVM, the SHA3 opcode calculates the Keccak256 of a given input buffer.
Tracking the constraints generated by cryptographic primitives (such as SHA3) is [notoriously](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19125-1_5) impractical. Simply put, the complexity of such procedures generate extremely complex constraints and immediately led to the state explosion of any state-of-the-art symbolic executor.

To overcome this issue, it is common practice to stub the `SHA3` opcode by returning a fresh unconstrained symbolic variable, and proceed with the analysis. However, this requires extra care: the connection between the result of the `SHA3` operation and the input buffer must be somehow modeled within the constraints.
To do this, we use a similar approach implemented by [ETHBMC](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20fall_frank_prepub_0.pdf) that leverages the [Ackerman encoding](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e4ac/6d84bd12069af44310c4e2816d6d9fc18d9e.pdf) for non-interpretable functions.

Practically, we handle the `SHA3` operation with a twofold strategy. First, during symbolic execution, and then, during the calculation of solutions for the symbolic variables.

**(1)** During symbolic execution, first we register all the information regarding the sha operation in the `sha_observed` attribute of a SimState (i.e., the snapshot of the state's memory at the SHA operation, the offset at which the input buffer is located, and the size of the requested operation). Then, in case the option `GREEDY_SHA` is active, we calculated (on the fly) the Keccak256 of fully concrete input buffers (or, symbolic buffers with one possible solution) and we assign this value to the result virtual registers. If no `GREEDY_SHA` is used  (or the input buffer is not concrete), we return a fresh symbolic variable (e.g., `<SHA1>`). Lastly, for every observed sha (i.e., `state.sha_observed`) we [instantiate constraints](https://github.com/ucsb-seclab/greed/blob/main/greed/sha3.py#L44) that encode the equality of the sha fresh symbolic variables whenever the input buffers are the same (i.e., basically encoding that the result of different `SHA3` opcodes that operate on equal input buffers MUST be the same). 

**(2)** Whenever an user requires to calculate solutions, e.g.: to synthethize the `CALLDATA` to reach a specific instruction, the first step is to "fix" the value for the input buffers for the observed shas (if any). TODO.

## Multi-Transactions Execution

The state of a smart contract evolve across multiple transactions.
With greed, it is possible to execute one symbolic execution against a contract, save one of its state as the final state, and create a new transaction to run against this new state.
We provide an example of this script [here]().
